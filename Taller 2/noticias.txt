iran arms deal just about ends his prospects of regaining political dominance in washington political analysts said this is certification of incompetence private political analyst stephen hess told s in commenting on the tower report made public today it s as if he went before a professional licensing board and was denied credentials in one of the most direct criticisms board chairman john tower a longtime reagan supporter and former republican senator from texas told a press conference the president clearly did not understand the nature of this operation the report which lent credence to widespread opinion in washington that reagan is not in full command of the government was particularly damaging because it was prepared by a board of the republican president s own choosing the three member panel made up of tower former national security adviser brent scowcroft and former secretary of state edmund muskie does not carry the partisan taint of criticism from a congress controlled by the democratic party we re falling by our own hand said one republican political strategist what can we say except we re sorry we won t do it again the strategist who works for one of his party s top presidential contenders and asked not to be identified said the report was like an anvil falling on us hess with the brookings institution public policy study group said the report is the final blow to reagan s hopes of regaining the upper hand he once had in dealings with congress the press and the washington bureaucracy the report may also undermine the standing of defense secretary caspar weinberger and secretary of state george shultz who the report suggests were more interested in keeping their own skirts clean than supporting the president they protected the record as to their own positions on this issue they were not energetic in attempting to protect the president from the consequences it said white house chief of staff donald regan and former central intelligence agency director william casey also received strong criticism but the blows were expected in their cases regan expected to resign or be fired shortly was savaged for allegedly failing both to help reagan conduct the iran initiative and to avoid chaos in the disclosure process casey who underwent surgery for removal of a cancerous brain tumor in december had already resigned for health reasons last month this is a story about people who came up somewhat short of being heroes tower told reporters while reagan retains considerable constitutional powers including command of the armed forces and the right to veto legislation analysts say it will be difficult for him to retake control of the country s policy agenda particularly with congress controlled by the democrats the crucial remaining question they said is whether the man in the street will forsake reagan over the affair although his job approval rating has fallen as much as twenty percentage points in some opinion polls since the arms deal with iran became public last november his personal popularity is still relatively high a los angeles times poll released earlier this week showed that just pct of those surveyed thought reagan was in control of the government but pct still thought he was doing a good job as president american enterprise institute analyst william schneider a democrat says reagan s loss of support among washington power brokers could be offset by continued backing of the public in the past he has been able to go around the power elite by appealing directly to the public schneider said reagan will again plead his case that way in a televised address next week but one top republican strategist warned against expecting a dramatic turnaround the white house has to avoid building expectations that cannot be met said the strategist who requested anonymity they have to recognize there is no quick fix analysts also point out that reagan s personal popularity has not always translated into

economists still wanted confirmation of a steady policy in today s data which covered the two week bank statement period ended yesterday this need for additional reassurance was made all the more acute by the fed s decision yesterday to drain reserves from the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale purchase agreements for the first time since april of last year economists added today s data showed that the draining action was for a fairly large billion dlrs economists said the one thing that caught my eye were the relatively sizeable matched sales on wednesday said dana

government is facing growing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising down its growth targets and revising up its inflation forecasts for this year moving reluctantly into line with most private sector forecasts the government yesterday raised its inflation estimate a half percentage point to per cent and cut its economic growth estimate to between two and per cent from a per cent target written into the annual budget last september finance minister edouard balladur said the revised figures would not push the government off its chosen mix of price deregulation budget cutting rigour and pay restraint but trade union leaders served immediate notice they would push to protect the purchasing power of their members raising the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises and bank economists contacted by s said they believed prime minister jacques chirac could be forced by slow growth and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year perhaps in the autumn to boost his prospects in presidential elections due by april the outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago said societe generale economist alain marais we have the impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth this year the big question is whether the government s policy of wage moderation will be maintained he added the government has set public sector wage rises at aboout per cent this year with a three per cent ceiling for rises justified by increased productivity but the head of the socialist cfdt union federation edmond maire meeting with chirac today renewed union demands already rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher prices calling the government s policies unbalanced and unjust he also demanded investment incentives to boost employment he announced after his meeting that chirac had told him the government would spend two billion francs on a series of measures to boost employment and training andre bergeron a widely respected leader of the moderate force ouvriere labour group put similar demands to chirac earlier in the week while the communist led cgt the largest of france s unions declared the defence of its members earnings its top priority but with unemployment nearing per cent last month and still rising government supporters and some

reverse that commented michel develle economist at recently privatised banque paribas damaging transport and electricity strikes over christmas and the new year partly blamed by the government for higher inflation had undermined the unions power and popularity he said develle said paribas expected inflation to rise even more than the governments revised forecast perhaps to or per cent this year against last years per cent but that would still be an exceptional achievement considering that for the first time since the second world war all french prices have been freed he commented finance ministry officials said that the governments abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible for nearly a quarter of a per cent surge in january living costs but they claimed it was a once off phenomenon that should have no knock on impact on the rest of the year both marais and develle said they agreed with that so long as the government kept wages under control prices could rise per cent in the first three months of and two per cent in the first half year fractionally more than forecast this week by the national statistics institute insee marais said but the second half year should be better he added ironically one side effect of higher inflation could be to help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget deficit several analysts said so long as public

revival has led some observers to talk of miracles and created euphoria in some quarters about future growth prospects but many italian experts warn that the current wave of optimism is excessive i think all this foreign interest in the so called italian miracle is really exaggerated foreign observers always oscillate in the case of italy between complete pessimism and unwarranted optimism says luigi spaventa one of italy s leading economists and a professor at rome university according to spaventa these violent swings of mood have been occurring for the last years with italy one minute seen as the bad boy of europe and unable to raise a dollar and the next a worker of miracles and basking in admiration i think there s a lot of exaggeration once it used to be the underground economy and all the correspondents of foreign newspapers flocked to italy to study this that was another story about nothing like writing about a black cat in a dark room spaventa in tune with other economists and industrialists here stress italy s recent achievements particularly the dramatic and solid recovery in the fortunes of industrial enterprises but warns that the economy is still vulnerable profits of private sector firms such as fiat s p a fiat m and ing c olivetti and c s p a are booming the major state industries are back in the black after years of losses inflation has nosedived and the trade and balance of payments deficits have been slashed expectations by some experts that italy is poised to replace britain as the world s fifth largest economy have also boosted optimism italy itself has made it clear it is not happy with what it feels to be its second rate status among the major industrialised countries only this week it angrily demanded clarification of this status after being excluded from a meeting of finance ministers from the group of five g comprising the united states japan west germany france and britain italy said its exclusion from the meeting violated an agreement reached in tokyo last year to let italy and canada attend meetings held by the five whenever discussions concerned managing the international monetary system but italy needs first to tackle some fundamental problems still facing its economy economists and industrialists say we must not forget that ours is still a vulnerable economy warns fiat managing director cesare romiti he says that while italy s recent achievements are indeed cause for satisfaction and optimism the focus now should be on the problems still remaining rather than those already solved the country s huge state sector deficit high unemployment and a heavy dependence on imported oil are among the most worrying problems experts say the size of the state spending deficit estimated at billion lire in and targetted at billion lire this year means there is a risk inflation could spiral again says carlo scognamiglio head of the private luiss university in rome inflation fell into single digits for the first time in a decade in september and by january this year was running at pct but it is still not low enough to guarantee international competiveness economists and industrialists say and unemployment was running at pct nationally last october according to the latest official data recent official data showed that of a total million people seeking work in october almost pct were aged between and unemployment in the south was running at pct more than double that in the industrial north the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd recently forecast that italian gross domestic product gdp would rise rise three pct in after expanding pct in but it warned that growth was unlikely to be enough to check rising unemployment another problem is italy s reliance on imported raw materials the country imports around pct of its fuel needs this factor actually worked sharply in italy s favour last year when lower energy costs helped slash the country s trade deficit to billion lire by year end from billion lire in but economists say the improvement owes little to any structural change in the italian economy and that any reversal of the trend in costs could have serious consequences if italy truly wants to be counted among the world s top industrialised nations it also needs to tighten up stockmarket operating procedures and encourage firms to supply more quality information about their activities economists say italy has no controls on insider trading the country also needs to shed its rigid capital movements controls a european community directive

european and japanese banks the committee had played a useful role in and however noting the often different reactions of u s japanese and european banks funaro told journalists that brazil might adopt an approach involving separate discussions with the regions since debtor nations problems were normally treated on a case by case basis perhaps the same principle should apply to creditors central bank president francisco gros said brazil on february suspended indefinitely interest payments on billion dlrs owed to commercial banks followed last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions worth some billion dlrs funaro and gros spent two days at the end of last week in washington talking to government officials and international

u k the third largest exposure after the u s and japan the crisis began when brazil s trade surplus its chief means of servicing its foreign debt started to decline sharply and the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in the country s ate of inflation reserves were reported to have dropped below four billion dlrs funaro envisaged that any eventual solution to problems with brazil s billion dlr foreign debt would involve only partial servicing of the debt what we propose is to arrive at a mechanism of refinance for part of the service because we cannot service all that he said i really think we have to change the old rules asked why brazil was first approaching governments rather than the commercial banks themselves in its search for a solution to the crisis funaro said we must first talk to the governments and then we can talk to the banks because the banks have some limits it is a political discussion from our point of view he said funaro said he hoped next week to travel to talk to japanese and canadian government officials he would then talk to the commercial banks if i ve got some solution from the governments i can t take the burden only to the banks he was not sure how long it would take to reach a solution in discussions with governments brazil would review the mechanisms whereby finance was made available to nations in need finance from official lending agencies had been virtually closed since you must open these mechanisms he said he said that while the u s officials had been disturbed by brazil s suspension of interest payments they understood brazil had no other choice as it had to protect its reserves also the financing mechanisms had to be discussed because we can t stay as we were the last few years i m trying to put the problem on the table all of us would like to have a kind of equilibrium he said although brazil has rejected a substantive role for the international monetary fund imf in managing its economy funaro

brazil to achieve a minimum eight billion dlr trade surplus in banking sources noted that brazil s monthly surplus had declined to some mln dlrs in the final three months of last year against a monthly one billion in the first nine months brazil had the third largest trade surplus in the world funaro said although its share of international trade was only one pct the solution is linked with growth not recession he said noting an imf program would involve promoting exports and inducing an internal recession in order to service debt banking sources said brazil s debts to foreign

petition asking the exchange to tighten rules covering trading activities in the widely popular standard and poor s stock index futures pit an exchange executive said the petition calls for elimination of dual trading a legal practice where traders execute customer orders as well as trade for their own account but exchange officials noted this practice also provides an opportunity for a trader to engage in what is called front running where traders enter orders for their own account before executing orders for their customers leo melamed cme special counsel said directors will rule on the petition on wednesday but added that a special s and p advisory committee has been studying s and p futures trading conditions for the last six months and is expected to submit a complete list of recommendations within days in addition to a recommendation on dual trading melamed said the special committee will also make suggestions about a possible automatic order entry and execution system for s and p futures and futures options and rule changes that would alleviate congested conditions in the trading pit melamed said directors are likely to approve the recommendations of the special committee because most actions of the board are in line with committee recommendations cme senior vice president gerald beyer said if the board accepts the member s petition this week a rule change will be submitted to the commodity futures trading commission for approval if the board does nothing or rejects the petition request a rule change must then be submitted to the exchange membership for a vote within days beyer said melamed also added that if the petition must be ruled on before the recommendations from the special committee are made it will confuse the issue not all traders agree on

as last year unemployment could climb to pct of the workforce by mid from its present pct it said in an annual review of the french economy the report said the french economy was increasingly ill adapted to demand selling goods at uncompetitive relative prices on both domestic and export markets france s poor export performance reflects a geographical bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average and a substantial loss of market share in the past months it said pointing to a likely widening of the french trade deficit to around billion dlrs this year from billion in it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the franc could lead to a renewed loss of competitiveness relative not only to the united states but also to the newly industrialised countries this could result in further major losses of market share particularly in the non oecd area which accounts for almost a quarter of french exports it said until the competitive ability of industry improved the authorities would have little scope for macroeconomic manoeuvre even if the unemployment situation or the need to encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow more briskly it added but rising unemployment could help to hold down wage demands contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a two pct annual rate this year and early next the oecd said written mainly in

took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke runaway rises and it is not absolutely certain that bet has been lost one oecd official commented oecd officials said the january data and a

to between and pct from two pct against last year s pct but the oecd backed the government s view that the underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year s fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of disinflation with french unit productivity costs now among the lowest in the oecd area the inflation differential between france and its main trading rival west germany could fall to just one pct this year it said on the other hand the report noted consumer prices for industrial goods and private services have

volcker term likely last week s white house shake up has increased the odds that federal reserve board chairman paul volcker a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the arms to iran scandal will serve a third term sources close to the fed say but they said that no decision on the appointment which must be filled this august has been taken by the white house and volcker too has not made up his mind former white house chief of staff donald regan who resigned last week when ex senator howard baker was named as his replacement was implacably opposed to volcker and tried often to undermine him it is an open secret in washington that regan tried to ensure that volcker first appointed in by president carter will not be offered a third term by president reagan only volcker s key allies in the reagan administration vice president george bush and treasury secretary james baker kept regan s recent maneuvering at bay the sources said sources close to the administration say regan leaked a story quickly shot down by others in the administration that beryl sprinkel chairman of the council of economic advisers had been chosen to replace volcker but as the administration s credibility was increasingly under fire it became clear that regan s power to bring about such changes was on the wane the sources said new white house chief of staff howard baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the treasury department and is likely to respect his views on the fed chairmanship as a moderate republican baker is also unlikely to share the right wing s opposition to volcker this new white house is going to need all the strength it can get said one source when asked about the possibility of volcker s reappointment paul volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both in the united states and around the world at a time when the stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor nations are in question volcker s departure would definitely undermine u s leadership foreign exchange analysts say u s officials say volcker works very closely with treasury secretary baker on issues like international debt and global economic cooperation the two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate the banking industry but recent statements by volcker in which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation signalled the politically independent central bank is coming around at least partially to the treasury position and a recent statement by a reagan administration official that the two men saw exactly eye to eye on the dollar was seen as an indication of baker s support for the fed chairman baker is understood to have played a key role in volcker s reappointment to the fed in mid the sources said baker respects volcker and when appointed treasury secretary in february he decided to ensure a good working relationship in part because he believed the two key government economic institutions have to work closely regan treasury secretary during president reagan s first term was formerly head of wall street s largest brokerage firm merrill lynch and came to washington determined to be america s pre eminent economic spokesman he developed a deep antipathy for volcker whose political skills undermined that ambition and who financial markets took much more seriously but the sources said volcker would have to be invited to stay is the president going to ask him he wouldn t stay otherwise said one he d have to be asked said stephen axilrod formerly staff director of monetary policy at the fed and now vice chairman of nikko securities co international otherwise the list of potential candidates is not awe inspiring and if volcker left this augsut he would leave behind one of the most inexperienced fed boards in years many analysts believe this lack of collective experience the four sitting members were all appointed within the last three years is dangerous coming at a time when the global economy is threatened by instability an experienced successor therefore would seem a necessity one widely mentioned possibility is secretary of state george shultz whose experience as treasury secretary under preesident nixon and background as a trained economist would make him ideal but shultz too may have been damaged by the arms to iran scandal while vice chairman manuel johnson is

change laws which limit its exports the official international business newspaper today published china s demands in a editorial to coincide with the visit of u s secretary of state george shultz it is extremely important that the u s market reduce its restrictions on chinese imports provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand chinese exports the editorial said the u s should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for chinese goods and admit china into the generalised system of preference gsp despite easing of curbs on u s technology exports in recent years control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries it added the paper also printed an article by china s commercial counsellor in its washington embassy chen shibiao who said that all kinds of difficulties and restrictions were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential he named them as u s

sufficient political will in the u s to change them china has been the subject of about a dozen cases involving anti dumping in the u s within the last two years which the u s side won he said but for the first time china signed last week an agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain exports of at least two categories of steel goods which may lead the u s side to withdraw the anti dumping case he added another diplomat said willingness to provide such voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in bilateral trade issues and in peking s application to gatt china has the potential to disrupt world markets especially in textiles other gatt countries will be nervous about china in this respect but there is a precedent for other centralled planned economies in gatt

opportunities and enhance market access for exports worldwide china can further develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum benefit from its gatt participation he said the problems facing u s china trade and gatt membership are similar a pricing system which many foreign businessmen regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs especially for exports and a de facto dual

board chairman paul volcker a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the arms to iran scandal will serve a third term sources close to the fed say but they said that no decision on the appointment which must be filled this august has been taken by the white house and volcker too has not made up his mind former white house chief of staff donald regan who resigned last week when ex senator howard baker was named as his replacement was implacably opposed to volcker and tried often to undermine him it is an open secret in washington that regan tried to ensure that volcker first appointed in by president carter will not be offered a third term by president reagan only volcker s key allies in the reagan administration vice president george bush and treasury secretary james baker kept regan s recent maneuvering at bay the sources said sources close to the administration say regan leaked a story quickly shot down by others in the administration that beryl sprinkel chairman of the council of economic advisers had been chosen to replace volcker but as the administration s credibility was increasingly under fire it became clear that regan s power to bring about such changes was on the wane the sources said new white house chief of staff howard baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the treasury department and is likely to respect his views on the fed chairmanship as a moderate republican baker is also unlikely to share the right wing s opposition to volcker this new white house is going to need all the strength it can get said one source when asked about the possibility of volcker s reappointment paul volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both in the united states and around the world at a time when the stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor nations are in question volcker s departure would definitely undermine u s leadership foreign exchange analysts say u s officials say volcker works very closely with treasury secretary baker on issues like international debt and global economic cooperation the two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate the banking industry but recent statements by volcker in which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation signalled the politically independent central bank is coming around at least partially to the treasury position and a recent statement by a reagan administration official that the two men saw exactly eye to eye on the dollar was seen as an indication of baker s support for the fed chairman baker is understood to have played a key role in volcker s reappointment to the fed in mid the sources said baker respects volcker and when appointed treasury secretary in february he decided to ensure a good working relationship in part because he believed the two key government economic institutions have to work closely regan treasury secretary during president reagan s first term was formerly head of wall street s largest brokerage firm merrill lynch and came to washington determined to be america s pre eminent economic spokesman he developed a deep antipathy for volcker whose political skills undermined that ambition and who financial markets took much more seriously but the sources said volcker would have to be invited to stay is the president going to ask him he wouldn t stay otherwise said one he d have to be asked said stephen axilrod formerly staff director of monetary policy at the fed and now vice chairman of nikko securities co international otherwise the list of potential candidates is not awe inspiring and if volcker left this augsut he would leave behind one of the most inexperienced fed boards in years many analysts believe this lack of collective experience the four sitting members were all appointed within the last three years is dangerous coming at a time when the global economy is threatened by instability an experienced successor therefore would seem a necessity one widely mentioned possibility is secretary of state george shultz whose experience as treasury secretary under preesident nixon and background as a trained economist would make him ideal but shultz too may have been damaged by the arms to iran scandal while vice chairman manuel johnson is regarded at years old as too young for the job other potential candidates include economist alan

seek authorization to be lead underwriters of new issues in the euromarkets in addition the bank has proposed limits on the amount of credit risk that firms can take on with each new issue they lead manage the proposed rules were outlined today in a consultative paper on large credit exposures taken by recognized banks and deposit takers and may be modified the bank said the rules could affect billions of dollars of eurobond securities issued each year in about billion dlrs of new eurobonds were offered according to figures compiled by euromoney magazine up until now there have been no restrictions on lead managing eurobond issues however eurobond market participants believe the bank of england is concerned about intense competition for market share which may have caused some firms to expose themselves to imprudent credit risk competition for market share has been a boon to issuers as banks compete to offer the best terms but the new rules suggest that some constraints may be placed on competition as regulators attempt to ensure that no bank takes on more risk than it can handle banking sources said that while the bank of england is reluctant to inhibit competition it is willing to accept some constraints in order to ensure that underwriters act prudently the bank s assessment of the appropriateness of a bank s lead underwriting activity will depend primarily upon the skill and experience of the lead underwriter in the particular market concerned the bank s proposal said once a firm has received permission to act as lead underwriter the exposure will be valued at one sixth of the face amount of the securities nominal exposure exceeding pct of capital must be reported to the bank of england and it must be notified in advance for exposure of over pct of capital the exposure will be determined to exist for a maximum of days following a binding commitment to underwrite after that any remaining exposure from unsold securities will be assessed at their full face value the rules would not apply to syndicated loan facilities revolving credits or commercial paper the bank said the bank also amended other aspects of plans to strengthen its supervisory powers over banks in the paper which called for comments from professionals by march to allow their possible inclusion in the banking bill in time for its planned final discussion in parliament scheduled before summer the new banking bill updating the banking act is the third leg of the conservative government s legislation for the supervision of financial institutions it is to feature alongside the financial services act aimed to bolster investor protection and the building societies act which put these institutions on an equal footing with banks the proposed legislation would abolish distinctions between recognised banks and licensed deposit takers and tighten legal controls making it a criminal offence to mislead supervisors proposals to require banks to inform the bank of england in advance of planned exposures in excess of pct of their capital and to have the bank supervise exposures between and pct of capital were not under debate the paper showed however preliminary consultations with bank representatives had shown some of the initial proposals to be flawed it said most proposed changes involved evaluating exposures on a case by case basis rather than along general lines amendments involved the bank s proposed treatment of exposures by financial institutions acting as banker to other units of their own group of companies the paper showed they also regarded the treatment of credit exposure to local governments and other public sector entities and of exposures undertaken by banks that are subsidiaries of banks proposals on how to value securities given by a debtor as collateral to a credit were slightly changed the paper showed exposures taken on by banks acting as creditor within their own group of companies would usually be looked into on a case by case basis under new proposals it said the paper said exposures to state owned industries and other public sector authorities in the u k and abroad should be given the more lenient treatment of credits to governments provided a government gives unconditional repayment guarantees it cautioned that exposures to u k local authorities and those guaranteed by the british export credit guarantee department would probably not qualify for such treatment on credits granted by banks which are a subsidiary of another bank an earlier proposed pct of capital ceiling could be exceeded in individual cases but the parent bank would have to give a formal undertaking to take over the exposure if problems were to occur and state in writing that the exposure was retained in the subsidiary s balance sheet to meet precise group objectives the paper said on collateral security it said this should normally only be taken into account when considering the acceptability of a bank s exposure up to pct of its capital base the presence of security taken on its own will be considered by the bank as an acceptable reason for an exposure in excess of pct but only in the most exceptional

weather and crop analysts said prospects for another near record grain harvest in the soviet union appear dim at this point but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems analysts said but the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the soviet grain supply and future buying plans analysts of the soviet union said from a weather standpoint you can say with certainty that the soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a lower crop than last year gail martell chief meteorologist for e f hutton said the next six weeks in the ussr s grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops martell and other analysts said where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us an agriculture department authority on the ussr said the soviet union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill this would be equal to about pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years the usda analyst said with a timely spring soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops sometimes as much as pct lower normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures this winter however snowcover in soviet grain areas has generally been excellent so the bulk of winterkill analysts speculate likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination fall dryness may be a problem there s a good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness martell said precipitation last fall was as little as pct of normal in southern and northern ukraine and below normal over the entire winter crop area she said recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice crusting and winterkill jim candor senior forecaster for accu weather said livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter analysts said the dry fall

talks coffee prices may have to fall even lower to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the negotiating table to discuss export quotas ico delegates and traders said the failure last night of international coffee organization ico producing and consuming countries to agree export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee futures markets today with the london may price reaching a year low at one stage of stg per tonne before ending the day at stg down stg from the previous close the new york may price was down at cents a lb pressure will now build up on producers returning from the ico talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor under prices some senior traders said the ico day average price stood at cents a lb for march this compares with a target range of to cents a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in february last year following a sharp rise in international prices caused by drought damage to the brazilian crop in a interview brazilian coffee institute ibc president jorio dauster urged producers not to panic and said they need to make hard commercial decisions if we have failed at the ico at least we have tried dauster said adding now it is time to go and sell coffee but brazil is keeping its marketing options open it plans to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next month dauster said it is too difficult to forecast now trade sources have put the crop at over mln bags compared with a previous crop of mln brazil is defining details of public selling tenders for coffee bought on london s futures market last year a basic condition will be that it does not go back to the market in one go but is sold over a minimum of six months the breakdown of the ico negotiations reflected a split between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for future quotas consumers said objective criteria like average exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares dauster said all elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but consumers insisted they did not want a return to the ad hoc way of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ico dauster said stocks and exports to ico members and non members all need to be considered when setting quotas and that brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings it is a simplistic misconception that brazil can dictate policy to other producers while consumer countries are welcome to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very difficult to allocate as different objective criteria achieve different share outs of quota dauster said other delegates said there was more open talking at the ico and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to accept the producers offer to abandon quotas if it proves impossible to find an acceptable basis for them we want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if supplies are needed at a later stage one delegate said some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ico session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse and how much producers will sink their differences should prices fall further and remain depressed the ico executive board meets here march to april but both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real negotiations will begin then the board is due to meet in indonesia in june with a full council scheduled for september more cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and politics in debt heavy latin american producer countries could bring ico members back around the negotiating table sooner than many imagine in that case quotas could come into force during the summer but most delegates and traders said quotas before october are unlikely while brazil s dauster noted the ico has continued although there were no quotas from to a clear difference between the pressures already being felt by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could not be imposed now at least in that way they said they could show a direct relationship between quotas and availability in contrast producers wanted stop gap quotas to plug the

changes repurchase pact system the bundesbank is planning changes in the system by which banks bid for funds in securities repurchase pacts to improve the flexibility of its key open market instrument central bank officials said banking economists said the changes will shorten the tender process to two days from three currently enabling the bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts of shorter maturity if it chooses to steer money market liquidity more flexibly the changes will probably come into force in april under the current system banks must themselves specify at the tender which securities they will sell to the bundesbank for subsequent repurchase a time consuming business banks hold securities for this purpose in safe custody accounts in the landeszentralbank lzb regional central banks which are the local offices of the bundesbank at state level some billion marks of securities are held in such accounts at the hesse lzb which covers the frankfurt area the change to come into force next month will allow the bundesbank access to these accounts to select the bonds itself in a process legally comparable to direct debiting at present the bundesbank generally announces a tender on monday holds the tender late on tuesday morning announces the result early tuesday afternoon and allocates funds wednesday the bundesbank generally sets repurchase pacts running days but sometimes public holidays result in longer pacts or longer tender periods being necessary for instance the bundesbank announced a tender last friday to be held today wednesday for crediting funds tomorrow thursday the advance announcement took into account the carnival holiday in duesseldorf on monday and in frankfurt yesterday tuesday central bank officials and money market dealers said the shortening of the tender process should be seen as purely technical with no direct implications for interest rates it is not a credit policy matter but a technical matter said an official at the hesse lzb

plan the proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks associated with interest rate swaps forward foreign exchange contracts and similar financial instruments previously the fed jan proposed a series of guidelines for calculating the risk of other off balance sheet activities that banks would be required to take into account in calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to maintain both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans and other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that would establish a bank s minimum capital needs the additional guidelines proposed today would determine the amount of capital support required for a bank s current exposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure the current exposure would be measured by the mark to market value of the asset which would reflect the replacement cost potential future increases in the replacement cost would be calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical analyses by the staffs of the bank of england and u s banking regulators future exposure would rise over the life of the asset the fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance conflicting needs for precision and simplicity they ignore for example the relative volatility of the particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts board officials said the new gauge could increase the capital required of the largest money center banks which are the principal participants in these types of activities they cautioned the fed board to take account of the potential impact of the plan on the ability of u s banks to compete in world financial markets however the staff concluded the credit risks inherent in such contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk

pillars on which japan rests its hopes of sustained economic growth both look rotten at the core economists polled by s said profits and domestic consumption are meant to replace exports as the engine of growth but close ties between corporate performance and wages mean that the alternative economic model promises little but slower growth they said falling profits may lead to falling incomes which in turn will cut sales and further reduce profits the bank of japan said in its latest outlook that improved terms of trade linked to the strong yen would help domestic demand grow steadily however this would happen only if household spending increased in line with the value of real financial assets due to stable prices and or if corporate investment recovered as profits from domestic sales improved compared with those from exports no clear sign of such developments has so far been evidenced the central bank said poor business prospects are the reason why economic growth will be slow even though japan s terms of trade have improved sharply due to the strong yen economist david pike of phillips and drew estimates that in unit cost prices fell pct while output prices fell only eight pct giving a large price margin advantage in the domestic market as long as companies did not pass that advantage on to the consumer last year s gap of almost percentage points between the fall in the wholesale price index and the slight drop in consumer prices shows that gains from the improved terms of trade have been kept as profits by producers and distributors the economists however believe this layer of fat will protect companies for only a short while as more firms seek more profits at home instead of abroad already fierce domestic competition will increase fueled by lower priced imports retail prices will fall profit margins will suffer a december survey by top business organisation keidanren confirms this dim view is taken by the firms themselves of companies polled in the key manufacturing sector almost pct thought the high yen would create a drop in production volume and pct predicted a drop in corporate performance said keidanren economist kazuyuki kinbara main counter measures cited by the firms include cutting unprofitable operations reducing work to sub contractors which employ significant numbers of workers holding down wages and reducing bonuses the government has said it fears unemployment could soon double from three pct now unemployment and slow wage growth will obviously hurt sales but reduced bonuses and worries about individual financial security could be even more damaging twice a year bonuses provide wage earners with what amounts to an enforced lump sum in savings encouraging them to buy large consumer products and sparking a sales bonanza to save funds some big firms have begun a form of tied bonus forcing employees to spend it on the firm s own goods economists also predict japanese will not save less than the average pct of salary they do now on the contrary a poor outlook and lower disposable income could strengthen the resolve to put money aside for old age and illness education and housing the main drains on the working man s salary the last government survey of public opinion said over pct of citizens will continue to economise japan has a rapidly ageing population and minimal social security and its workers fear poverty in their old age faced with such a vicious circle the government s reflationary strategies are severely limited the commitment by the ruling liberal democratic party and finance ministry

reached that would withstand legal tests it might be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly but dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an airtight netting agreement that is

said andrew kim of eberstadt fleming i don t know whose going to buy them but at least this way it becomes a much more viable package said kim but icahn s financing ability for such a transaction

initiative was to develop relations with those who might assume leadership in a post khomeini government it s clear from the board s report however that i let my personal concern for the hostages spill over into the geo political strategy of reaching out to iran i asked so many questions about the hostages welfare that i didn t ask enough about the specifics of the total iran plan he said the commission headed by former republican sen john tower said reagan s intense compassion for americans being held by pro iranian groups in lebanon had resulted in an unprofessional and unsatisfactory policy it portrayed year old reagan as a man who did not know or care much about the wide ranging probably illegal activities of his national security council nsc staff which hatched the operation reagan said he endorsed all of the tower commission s recommendations about the running of the nsc adding in fact i m going beyond its recommendations so as to put the house in even better order he noted that he had appointed former senate republican leader howard baker as his new chief of staff and said he hoped baker would help him forge a new partnership with congress especially on foreign and national security policies he said his new national security adviser frank carlucci was rebuilding the national security staff with proper management discipline reagan said that almost half the

agreed to serve as a member of his foreign intelligence advisory board which acts as a watchdog on the nation s covert activities but he said that he had issued a directive barring the nsc staff itself from undertaking covert operations no ifs ands or buts tonight s speech was a far cry from reagan s initial strong defense of his iran policy in a televised speech last november reagan called charges that he ransomed hostages and undercut the u s war on terrorism utterly false as recently as two months ago in his state of the union speech reagan said that serious mistakes were made but defended the basic policy as one that had worthy goals by contrast tonight s speech had an apologetic tone that was a marked departure from reagan s usual upbeat confident demeanor he said he took full responsibility for his own actions and for those of my administration as angry as i may be about activities undertaken without my knowledge i am still accountable for those activities as disappointed as i may be in some who served me i am still the one who must answer to the american people for this behavior reagan said reagan said the message that the nation should move on had come

reach an agreement on eliminating medium range nuclear missiles in europe ", "1895": "reagan says iran policy records improperly kept president reagan said improper record keeping of meetings and

looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the group of five g industrial nations told s the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the japan u s trade axis into a japan european community ec axis to the discomfort of europe in many ways not least in terms of rare international cooperation the september new york plaza pact between the u s japan west germany britain and france to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one but it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture in which the plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance but not necessarily central significance the officials said the officials said that when the plaza agreement took place the dollar was already on its way down the agreement simply helped it on its way

the u s against about a third in recent years trade with the u s in rose pct for exports and pct for imports in dollar terms but fell pct for exports and pct for imports in yen terms the basic meaning for europe is that japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to europe where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms which is what is important to them suddenly instead of the u s it is europe that is laying the golden egg said de hora the ec is worried ec business also had a remarkable year in japanese sales but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base compared with total japan u s trade the japanese think ec firms are now more competitive than u s firms a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance and which will cause problems this

despite the mark s strength against the dollar and other major currencies the danger that exports will slump in appears all in all limited the report said on the contrary a slight rise in exports can

ranges they will be aided in by an expected slight rise in economic growth in industrial countries at the same time the decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow this year west german gnp growth in will be led by renewed advances in domestic consumption and investment spending both of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary policy the institute said however it said the labour market would see only a slight improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by agreed reductions in working

the annual report of the committee surveys a trillion dlr economy whose tranquil appearance obscures the danger signals that lie just below the surface committee chairman sen paul sarbanes said in a

down taken together the outlook for fiscal and monetary policy is thus not very encouraging the democrats said the democrats called on the administration to be more aggressive in removing foreign trade barriers and in seeking new initiatives to solve the international debt problem the democrats said much of the u s trade deficit had been caused by misalignment of the world s currencies
