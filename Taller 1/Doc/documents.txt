regaining political\ndominance in washington, political analysts said.\n    \"this is certification of incompetence,\" private political\nanalyst stephen hess told reuters in commenting on the tower\nreport made public today.\n    \"it's as if he went before a professional licensing board\nand was denied credentials.\"\n    in one of the most direct criticisms, board chairman john\ntower, a longtime reagan supporter and former republican\nsenator from texas, told a press conference, \"the president\nclearly did not understand the nature of this operation.\"\n    the report, which lent credence to widespread opinion in\nwashington that reagan is not in full command of the\ngovernment, was particularly damaging because it was prepared\nby a board of the republican president's own choosing.\n    the three-member panel made up of tower, former national\nsecurity adviser brent scowcroft and former secretary of state\nedmund muskie, does not carry the partisan taint of criticism\nfrom a congress controlled by the democratic party.\n    \"we're falling by our own hand,\" said one republican\npolitical strategist. \"what can we say except 'we're sorry, we\nwon't do it again'?\"\n    the strategist, who works for one of his party's top 1988\npresidential contenders and asked not to be identified, said\nthe report was like \"an anvil falling on us.\"\n    hess, with the brookings institution public policy study\ngroup, said the report is the final blow to reagan's hopes of\nregaining the upper hand he once had in dealings with congress,\nthe press and the washington bureaucracy.\n    the report may also undermine the standing of defense\nsecretary caspar weinberger and secretary of state george\nshultz, who the report suggests were more interested in keeping\ntheir own skirts clean than supporting the president.\n    \"they protected the record as to their own positions on this\nissue. they were not energetic in attempting to protect the\npresident from the consequences,\" it said.\n    white house chief of staff donald regan and former central\nintelligence agency director william casey also received strong\ncriticism, but the blows were expected in their cases.\n    regan, expected to resign or be fired shortly, was savaged\nfor allegedly failing both to help reagan conduct the iran\ninitiative and to avoid \"chaos\" in the disclosure process.\n    casey, who underwent surgery for removal of a cancerous\nbrain tumor in december, had already resigned for health\nreasons last month.\n    \"this is a story about people who came up somewhat short of\nbeing heroes,\" tower told reporters.\n    while reagan retains considerable constitutional powers,\nincluding command of the armed forces and the right to veto\nlegislation, analysts say it will be difficult for him to\nretake control of the country's policy agenda -- particularly\nwith congress controlled by the democrats.\n    the crucial remaining question, they said, is whether the\nman in the street will forsake reagan over the affair.\n    although his job approval rating has fallen as much as\ntwenty percentage points in some opinion polls since the arms\ndeal with iran became public last november, his personal\npopularity is still relatively high.\n    a los angeles times poll released earlier this week showed\nthat just 37 pct of those surveyed thought reagan was in\ncontrol of the government, but 55 pct still thought he was\ndoing a good job as president.\n    american enterprise institute analyst william schneider, a\ndemocrat, says reagan's loss of support among washington power\nbrokers could be offset by continued backing of the public.\n    \"in the past, he has been able to go around the power elite\nby appealing directly to the public,\" schneider said.\n    reagan will again plead his case that way in a televised\naddress next week.\n    but one top republican strategist warned against expecting\na dramatic turnaround.\n    \"the white house has to avoid building expectations that\ncannot be met,\" said the strategist, who requested anonymity.\n\"they have to recognize there is no quick fix.\"\n    analysts also point out that reagan's personal popularity\nhas not always translated into public backing for his policies.\n    they note he was dramatically rebuffed in last november's\nelections when voters rejected his appeals and restored control\nof the senate to the democrats.\n reuter\n\u0003", "29": "january housing sales drop, realty group says sales of previously owned homes\ndropped

1.34 billion two weeks earlier.\n    a federal reserve spokesman told a press briefing that\nthere were no large single day net misses in the fed's reserve\nprojections in the week to wednesday.\n    he said that natural float had been \"acting a bit\nstrangely\" for this time of year, noting that there had been\npoor weather during the latest week.\n    the spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500\nmln dlrs on friday, for which he could give no reason, to\nnearly one billion dlrs on both thursday and wednesday.\n    the fed spokeman could give no reason for thursday's high\nfloat, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of wednesday's\nfloat figure was due to holdover and transportation float at\ntwo widely separated fed districts.\n    for the week as a whole, he said that float related as of\nadjustments were \"small,\" adding that they fell to a negative\n750 mln dlrs on tuesday due to a number of corrections for\nunrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the\ncountry.\n    the spokesman said that on both tuesday and wednesday, two\ndifferent clearing banks had system problems and the securities\nand federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or\n2100 est on both days.\n    however, he said that both problems were cleared up during\nboth afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve\nimpact.\n    during the week ended wednesday, 45 pct of net discount\nwindow borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pct\nby the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional\ninstitutions.\n    on wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by\nthe money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and\n15 pct by the smallest banks.\n    the fed spokesman said the banking system had excess\nreserves on thursday, monday and tuesday and a deficit on\nfriday and wedndsday. that produced a small daily average\ndeficit for the week as a whole.\n    for the two-week period, he said

with the market\nvalue of its stock.\n    american express stock got a lift from the rumor, as the\nmarket calculated a partially public shearson may command a\ngood market value, thereby boosting the total value of american\nexpress. the rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial\nservices firm would split its stock and boost its dividend.\n    american express closed on the new york stock exchange at\n72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume.\n    american express would not comment on the rumors or its\nstock activity.\n    analysts said comments by the company at an analysts'\nmeeting tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement\nyesterday of management changes.\n    at the meeting, company officials said american express\nstock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance\nof shearson, according to analysts.\n    yesterday, shearson said it was elevating its chief\noperating officer, jeffery lane, to the added position of\npresident, which had been vacant. it also created four new\npositions for chairmen of its operating divisions.\n    analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most\nsense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total\nspinoff.\n    some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of\nshearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for\namerican express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings last\nyear.\n    \"i think it is highly unlikely that american express is\ngoing to sell shearson,\" said perrin long of lipper analytical.\nhe questioned what would be a better investment than \"a very\nprofitable securities firm.\"\n    several analysts said american express is not in need of\ncash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong\nasset.\n    but others believe the company could very well of\nconsidered the option of spinning out part of shearson, and one\nrumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market.\n    larry eckenfelder of prudential-bache securities said he\nbelieves american express could have considered a partial\nspinoff in the past.\n    \"shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a\nbig premium in the market place.

\"their obligation was to give the president their full\nsupport and continued advice with respect to the program or, if\nthey could not in conscience do that, to so inform the\npresident,\" the

in attempting to protect the\npresident from the consequences of his personal commitment to\nfreeing the hostages.\"\n    the report saved some of its most scathing language for\nregan, a gruff former

is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory\nfuture, the organisation for economic cooperation and\ndevelopment, oecd, said.\n    this reflected the success of stable and relatively tight\nfiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it\nsaid.\n    the oecd, in its annual report on switzerland, picked out\nsome signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in\ninflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern.\n    the study forecast a decline in gross domestic product\ngrowth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986\nand a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after\nlast year's sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985.\n    but it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest\nincrease in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate\nunchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial\nnation oecd area.\n    assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 swiss francs to\nthe dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986,\nthe report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct\nrise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct\nrespectively in 1986.\n    the faster growth of imports compared with exports this\nyear and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant\nthat the contribution of the foreign payments balance to gdp\nwould shrink in both years.\n    but \"given switzerland's large external surplus, there\nshould be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than\ngdp...which, if only in a small way, would contribute to\nimproving international balances,\" the oecd said.\n    real private consumption appeared to have been unusually\nbuoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several\nyears of relative weakness, it noted.\n    in 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat\nto a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall\ngdp, it added.\n    the outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained\nbright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels\nlast year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation\nin both the industry and service sectors, it said.\n    as a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment\ninvestment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year\nafter vigorous growth in 1986.\n    but the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for\ntourism and the banking industry, two major service sector\nearners of foreign exchange.\n    the long-term appreciation of the swiss franc, and the\naccelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could\nlead to a loss of international market share for both, it said.\n    particularly for the banks, \"recent developments in\ninternational financial markets give rise

processors association this afternoon at 21.78\nmln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over\nthe past two months when crush margins surged to the best\nlevels seen in over a year.\n    active soymeal export loadings at the gulf had pushed\nsoybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in the\nweekly crush number.\n    however, much of that export demand seems to have been met,\nwith most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge\nin shipments of new crop south american soymeal over the next\nfew months.\n    u.s. processors are now finding domestic

up to\ntoday.\"\n    although volcker's statement last thursday allayed most\nfears that the fed had marginally tightened its grip on\nreserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted\nconfirmation of a steady policy in today's data, which covered\nthe two-week bank statement period ended yesterday.\n    this need for additional reassurance was made all the more\nacute by the fed's decision yesterday to drain reserves from\nthe banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase\nagreements for the first time since april of last year,\neconomists added.\n

a neutral path,\nwith fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct,\" said darwin beck of\nfirst boston corp. \"i expect it to continue in that vein.\"\n    \"excess reserves fell but they are still over a

that would still be an exceptional achievement\nconsidering that for the first time since the second world war\nall french prices have been freed,\" he commented.\n    finance ministry officials said that the governments\nabolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible\nfor nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in january living\ncosts.\n    but they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should\nhave no knock-on impact on the rest of the year.\n    both marais and develle said they agreed with that, so long\nas the government kept wages under control.\n    prices could

other crops, the\nreport underlines.\n    the fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of\npests known as \"wereng\" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which\nlargely offset gains in yields.\n    the outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57\ninsecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now\nresistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more\nresistant rice types.\n    the government is depending on increased production of\nexport commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and\npalm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude\noil prices.\n    palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct\nin 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising\nto an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986,

demand.\n    the report said that indonesia\"s overall economic\nperformance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight\nnegative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the\nmid-1960s. it

bank.\nissues for all of february rose to nearly five billion marks,\nfrom 3.6 billion in january.\n    the heavy volume also meant most borrowers except the very\nbest addresses were having to accept higher coupons.\n    \"i think the d-mark market is still good, but only if you\ncan give a good coupon,\" another manager said.\n    but even some government borrowers were not getting the\nbest reception for bonds which would have been taken up more\nreadily under other conditions.\n    of the three mark eurobonds launched on tuesday alone,\nbonds for den danske bank and iceland were trading

its 99-1/2 price, thanks\nmainly to its shorter maturity, dealers said.\n    the large amount of paper brought to the market in the last\ntwo months has also led many syndicate managers to complain\nabout the bundesbank's present fixed calendar system, which\nthey say is too inflexible.\n    currently all mark denominated eurobonds have to be\nregistered with the bundesbank in the week preceding the\ntwo-week issue period. a bank may decline to issue a bond on\nthe requested day in the calendar, but then has to wait for the\nnext calendar period to schedule the bond again.\n    some managers said they would prefer to abolish the system.\n    the bundesbank shortened the reporting period to two weeks\nfrom four weeks last july. but few expect the calendar to be\ncompletely abolished. \"i don't think the bundesbank would give\nthat up,\" one banking analyst said.\n    \"i wouldn't have anything against getting rid of the system,\"\nthe analyst said, adding banks were capable of regulating the\nvolume of new issues themselves.\n    the bundesbank plays a passive role in setting the calendar\nwithout trying to regulate the issues, but it needs the\nregistration to gauge the volume of mark bonds going through\nthe euromarket, he said.\n    for this reason, few managers here foresee the bundesbank\nsacrificing its present calendar system.\n    bond activity in

which tripled\nlast year after quadrupling in 1985.\n    the target deficit in the 1987 budget approved by\nparliament last december was 43.8 billion forints.\n    but zoltan boesze, chief of the finance ministry's budget\nfinancing division, told reuters the government now saw this as\ntoo high and had decided \"quite severe\" measures were needed.\n    \"all the organizations of economic management have been\ncharged with elaborating further (savings) measures,\" he said.\n    asked if these measures were being taken under pressure\nfrom the international monetary fund (imf), boesze said: \"the\nfund suggested it would be good to improve monetary results,\nand of course the fund would support these efforts.\"\n    imf teams spent several weeks in budapest late last year.\n    boesze said preliminary figures showed that hungary's state\nbudget deficit rose to a preliminary 47 billion forints last\nyear from 15.8 billion in 1985 and 3.7 billion in 1984.\n    the economy overshot a target deficit of 23 billion forints\nbecause of poor performance by state firms, which needed\nsubsidies and tax incentives to export and earn hard currency.\n    the exact extent and nature of savings are still under\ndiscussion but subsidies to state enterprises -- the largest\nbudget item -- must definitely fall, boesze said.\n    subsidies to state firms, including grants to maintain low\nconsumer prices, exceeded the plan by nine billion to reach 164\nbillion forints in 1986, up from 152.9 billion in 1985.\nparliament approved 1987 subsidies of 170 billion forints.\n    \"i think that in 1987 it is quite impossible to keep up the\nformer situation and we will be obliged to reduce subsidies,\"\nboesze said. \"the central administration must be hard. ... if we\nare not hard then we will not be successful.\"\n    boesze said the budget could also make savings from reserve\nprovisions of two billion forints for central expenditure and\n800 mln forints for transfers to local authorities. \"i believe\nthese reserves should not be used at all,\" he said.\n    wage growth last year outstripped that of gross domestic\nproduct, which expanded one pct instead of a planned 2.5 pct.\n    the authorities had already signalled a small fall in real\nwages for 1987, but boesze said firms will suffer severe tax\npenalties if they award nominal rises of over one or two pct.\n    this would mean a severe cut in living standards, as retail\nprice inflation is forecast at seven pct after 5.3 pct in 1986.\n    a four-month basic wage freeze expires on april 1.\n    about 40 pct of the 1986 subsidies to state enterprises and\n33 pct in 1985 were made to maintain low consumer prices.\n    boesze said pure economic policy would dictate significant\ncuts in price subsidies, but that social considerations made\nthis difficult.\n    but he added: \"i think ultimately we will be able to make\ncurtailments in subsidies in this area as well.\"\n    he said hungary plans to introduce price reform at the\nbeginning of 1988 at the same time as personal taxation and\nvalue added tax. the imf supports these aims.\n    hungary introduced a bankrupcty law last september in an\nattempt to shake out surplus labour from inefficient firms.\n    between 100,000 and 150,000 workers are expected to be\nunemployed at least temporarily by 1990. labour discipline is\nbeing tightened and firms may fire workers more easily.\n    boesze said the per capita employment tax paid to the state\nby firms was being raised this year to encourage enterprises to\nshed labour. he gave no exact figures.\n    istvan nagy, a senior finance ministry official responsible\nfor drafting the bankrupcy law, told reuters last year he hoped\nthe law would cut state subsidies to enterprises by 50 pct.\n    after subsidies to state enterprises, the largest single\nbudget items are social insurance (153 billion forints approved\nfor 1987) and transfers to local councils (80 billion).\n    interest payments on international debt are set to rise to\nmore than 10 billion forints in 1987 from between six and seven\nbillion in 1986, boesze said.\n    hungary's net hard currency debt leapt by 54 pct last year\nto 7.7 billion dlrs, according to provisional figures, while\ntrade with western countries plunged into a deficit of more\nthan 400 mln dlrs from a 1.2 billion

between complete pessimism and\nunwarranted optimism,\" says luigi spaventa, one of italy's\nleading economists and a professor at rome university.\n    according to spaventa, these violent swings of

at\n109,561 billion lire in 1986 and targetted at 100,000 billion\nlire this year -- means there is a risk inflation could spiral\nagain, says carlo scognamiglio, head of the private luiss\nuniversity in rome.\n    inflation fell into single digits for the first time in a\ndecade in september 1984 and by january this year was running\nat 4.5 pct, but it is still not low enough to guarantee\ninternational competiveness, economists and industrialists say.\n    and unemployment was running at 11.6 pct nationally last\noctober according to the latest official data.\n    recent official data showed that of a total 2.77 million\npeople seeking work in october 1986, almost 73 pct were aged\nbetween 14 and 29. unemployment in the south was running at\n17.7 pct, more than double that in the industrial north.\n    the organisation for economic cooperation and development\n(oecd) recently forecast that italian gross domestic product\n(gdp) would rise rise three pct in 1987 after expanding 2.5 pct\nin 1986. but it warned that growth was unlikely to be enough to\ncheck rising unemployment.\n    another problem is italy's reliance on imported raw\nmaterials. the country imports around 80 pct of its fuel needs.\n    this factor actually worked sharply in italy's favour last\nyear, when lower energy costs helped slash the country's trade\ndeficit to 3,717 billion lire  by year end from 23,085 billion\nlire in 1985.\n    but economists say the improvement owes little to any\nstructural change in the italian economy and that any reversal\nof the trend in costs could have serious consequences.\n    if italy truly wants to be counted among the world's top\nindustrialised nations, it also needs to tighten up stockmarket\noperating procedures and encourage firms to supply more quality\ninformation about their activities, economists say.\n    italy has no controls on insider trading.\n    the country also needs to shed its rigid capital movements\ncontrols -- a european community directive calls for these to\nbe dismantled by 1992 -- but this too will require a less\nblinkered attitude and a change in traditional operating\nprocedures, economists say.\n

non-callable for life, the deal\nwas rated aaa by both moody's and standard and poor's.\n    underwriters away from the syndicate said they believed the\nbank of america deal was priced too aggressively. \"aaa-rated\nauto paper was trading about 75 basis points over treasuries\nwhen first boston priced the deal,\" one said.\n    however, dub said the offering sold out quickly anyway.\n    the first boston executive attributed this to the deal's\ntop-flight rating by both agencies, unlike many of last year's\ncars deals, which were rated by s and p alone.\n    \"investors receive interest only payments for the first 18\nmonths and then interest and principal payments for the\nremaining five to seven months,\" dub detailed.\n    investment bankers pointed out that because the

14-bank advisory committee which coordinates\nits commercial bank debt, finance minister dilson funaro said.\n    u.s. banks have 50 pct representation on the committee\nwhile holding only 35 pct of brazil's debt to banks, he said,\nadding \"this is not fair with the european and japanese banks.\"\nthe committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983,\nhowever.\n    noting the often different reactions of u.s., japanese and\neuropean banks, funaro told journalists that brazil might adopt\nan approach involving separate discussions with the regions.\n    since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on a\ncase-by-case basis, \"perhaps the same principle should apply to\ncreditors,\" central bank president francisco gros said.\n    brazil on february 20 suspended indefinitely interest\npayments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks, followed\nlast week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited\nby foreign banks and institutions, worth some 15 billion dlrs.\n    funaro and gros spent two days at the end of last week in\nwashington talking to government officials and international\nagencies and will this week visit britain, france, west\ngermany, switzerland and italy for discussions with\ngovernments.\n    funaro and gros are today meeting british chancellor of the\nexchequer nigel lawson, foreign secretary geoffrey howe and\ngovernor of the bank of england robin leigh-pemberton.\n    bankers have estimated that brazil owes u.k. banks around\n8.5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans, giving the u.k.\nthe third largest exposure after the u.s. and japan.\n    the crisis began when brazil's trade surplus, its chief\nmeans of servicing its foreign debt, started to decline sharply\nand the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in the\ncountry's\u007fate of inflation.  reserves were reported to have\ndropped below four billion dlrs.\n    funaro envisaged that any eventual solution to problems\nwith brazil's 108 billion dlr foreign debt would involve only\npartial servicing of the debt.\n    \"what we propose is to arrive at a mechanism of refinance\nfor part of the service, because we cannot service all that,\" he\nsaid. \"i really think we have to change the old rules.\"\n    asked why brazil was first approaching governments, rather\nthan the commercial banks themselves in its search for a\nsolution to the crisis, funaro said \"we must first talk to the\ngovernments and then we can talk to the banks, because the\nbanks have some limits.\"\n    \"it is a political discussion from our point of view,\" he\nsaid.\n    funaro said he hoped next week to travel to talk to\njapanese and canadian government officials. he would then talk\nto the commercial banks \"if i've got some solution from the\ngovernments. i can't take the burden only to the banks.\" he was\nnot sure how long it would take to reach a solution.\n \u007f  in discussions with governments brazil would review the\nmechanisms whereby finance was made available to nations in\nneed. finance from official lending agencies had been virtually\nclosed since 1982. \"you must open these mechanisms,\" he said.\n    he said that while the u.s. officials had been disturbed by\nbrazil's suspension of interest payments, they understood\nbrazil had no other choice, as it had to protect its reserves.\n    also the financing mechanisms had to be discussed \"because\nwe can't stay as we were the last few years.\"\n    \"i'm trying to put the problem on the table.... all of us\nwould like to have a kind of equilibrium.\" he said. although\nbrazil has rejected a substantive role for the international\nmonetary fund (imf) in managing its economy, funaro paid a call\nin washington to imf managing director michel camdessus and to\nworld bank president barber conable.\n    funaro noted that inflation in february had started to\ndecline again and he expected brazil to achieve a minimum eight\nbillion dlr trade surplus in 1987.\n    banking sources noted that brazil's monthly surplus had\ndeclined to some 150 mln dlrs in the final three months of last\nyear, against a monthly one billion in the first nine months.\n    brazil had the third largest trade surplus in the world,\nfunaro said, although its share of international trade was only\none pct.  \"the solution is linked with growth, not recession,\" he\nsaid, noting an imf program would involve promoting exports and\ninducing an internal recession in order to service debt.\n    banking sources said brazil's debts to foreign governments,\nas opposed to commercial banks, now benefit from a sounder\nstructure following last month's rescheduling by the paris club\nof creditor nations of 4.12 billion dlrs of official debt.\n

operation to adjust capacity to lower demand.\n    industry commissioner karl-heinz narjes has proposed the\nending of the quota system by december 1988.\n    he has proposed a return to the free market, which under ec\nlaw is supposed to exist except in times of \"manifest crisis.\"\n    but diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss this\nidea on march 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis in\ntheir countries, with orders falling as customers switch to\nalternative products and accounts firmly in the red.\n    ministers from the ec's major steel producing countries are\nlikely to shy away from narjes' proposals and could back the\nindustry's own plan instead, in the hope of minimising the\npolitical impact of plant closures, they said.\n    industry sources said the plan presented to narjes by the\nec steelmakers' lobby group eurofer would retain the quota\nproduction system at least until the end of 1990.\n    eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it\nidentified scope for closing plants on a \"voluntary\" basis to\nreduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year.\n    cuts were still insufficient in one production area, that\nof hot rolled coils, and further talks were needed.\n    eurofer added the industry would need the support of the\ncommission and governments in carrying out a closure program,\nparticularly with social costs such

use,\nnot for the open market.\n    the problem with memory chips is that they are all based on\nthe same, well known design standards, so they are easy to copy\nand inexpensive to manufacture. because such large japanese\nconglomerates as sony corp <sne>, nec corp, <nipny> matushita\nand mitsui have their own enormous consumer and electronics\nproduct lines, they also have a guaranteeed internal market for\ntheir chips, so they can produce huge amounts at a very low\ncost per unit.\n    customized chips, however, are designed for a specific\ncustomer, manufactured in small quantities and expensive\nrelative to standard chips. computer markets are increasingly\nlooking to customized chips because they are difficult to copy,\nthus making the final product harder to clone as well.\n    intel corp <intc>, the leading manufacturer of the\nmicroprocessors that form the brains of most computers, alerted\nthe industry to its intention to switch to customized chips\nlast fall.\n    the company, which just reported a loss for 1986, said it\nwill spend 75 mln dlrs over the next three years to turn itself\ninto a leading manufacturer of custom and semi-custom chips.\n    intel joins some 275 companies already competing for a\npiece of the customized chip business but it has an advantage\nthat the others do not. ibm, which owns a 20 pct stake in\nintel, has agreed to share the designs for many of the 15,000\nchips it makes for its own use. intel will customize those\ndesigns and sell them to others.\n    it will also get to use ibm's proprietary computer system\nfor designing chips, considered by experts to be one of the\nmost advanced in the world.\n    intel's success is still not guaranteed, however. industry\nanalysts noted that it is far different to design a mass market\nitem than a customized chip that requires a close working\nrelationship with the customer.\n    intel spent five years and 100 mln dlrs developing its\nnewest 30386 microprocessor. a much faster turnarouond time,\nand much lower development costs, will be required for\ncustomized chips if the firm is to succeed.\n reuter\n\u0003", "637": "continental ill <cil> to recharacterize

"government bond broker sees wider data access the major u.s. government bond brokers\nare likely to give in to pressure from regulators and investors\nwithin the next 18 months, making their direct-dealing screens\navailable to many of those firms that are not now eligible to\nreceive them, said richard lacy, chairman of exco international\ninc.\n    earlier today, exco said it purchased an 80 pct interest in\nrmj holdings corp, one of the largest of the four bond brokers\nthat dominate the business.\n    in a telephone interview, lacy said \"within 18 months, we\nthink the number of players will be expanded.\"\n    currently, the four major brokers will sell their\ndirect-dealing screens to only primary dealers in u.s.\ngovernment securities or those that have applied to the federal\nreserve bank of new york to become a primary dealer.\n    the u.s. justice department is looking into whether\nlimiting access to the screens to just a small group of dealers\nis a violation of u.s. anti-trust laws.\n    primary dealers, of which there are now 40, are an elite\ngroup of firms approved to buy treasury securities directly\nfrom the fed.\n    but lacy said that any agreement to expand access to the\nbrokers' direct-dealing screens is likely to be not as\nfar-reaching as some would like. instead of making screens\navailable to any firm willing to pay for one, he said, it is\nmore likely that a \"second tier\" will be established.\n    he also said that rmj is not willing to break away from the\ngroup of bond brokers and be the only firm to make its screens\nwidely available to any one who wants them.\n    bond market sources had speculated that rmj is better\nprepared to offer its services nationwide than its three major\ncompetitors.\n    lacy also said that he does not see any immediate pressure\nfor a further cut in commissions paid on bond transactions any\ntime soon. in late 1985, transaction fees paid to brokers were\ncut in half to 39 dlrs per mln dlr transaction from 78 dlrs.\n    some u.s. primary bond dealers have been suggesting that\nwith further increases in transaction volume, fees can be cut\nwithout hurting the brokers' profits.\n

representing 20 pct of the equity\ninterest in the restructured viacom. one arbitrageur calculated\nthe equity in the redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the\ntotal package worth 52 dlrs per

arsenal is not consummated. the\nplan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct\nduring may and 12 pct thereafter. previously redstone offered\neight pct interest.\n    other

around 2.5 or three pct.\n    the government last week revised its forecast up to between\n2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct, against last year's 2.1 pct.\n    but the oecd backed the government's view

of\ndisinflation.\n    with french unit productivity costs now among the lowest in\nthe oecd area, the inflation differential between france and\nits main trading rival, west germany, could fall to

makes 3rd volcker term likely last week's white house shake-up has\nincreased the odds that federal reserve board chairman paul\nvolcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the\narms-to-iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close to\nthe fed say.\n    but they said that no decision on the appointment, which\nmust be filled this august, has been taken by the white house\nand volcker too has not made up his mind.\n    former white house chief of staff donald regan, who\nresigned last week when ex-senator howard baker was named as\nhis replacement, was implacably opposed to volcker and tried\noften to undermine him.\n    it is an open secret in washington that regan tried to\nensure that volcker, first appointed in 1979 by president\ncarter, will not be offered a third term by president reagan.\n    only volcker's key allies in the reagan administration,\nvice-president george bush and treasury secretary james baker,\nkept regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said.\n    sources close to the administration say regan leaked a\nstory, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that\nberyl sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers,\nhad been chosen to replace volcker.\n    but as the administration's credibility was increasingly\nunder fire, it became clear that regan's power to bring about\nsuch changes was on the wane.\n    the sources said new white house chief of staff howard\nbaker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the\ntreasury department and is likely to respect his views on the\nfed chairmanship.\n    as a moderate republican, baker is also unlikely to share\nthe right-wing's opposition to volcker.\n    \"this new white house is going to need all the strength it\ncan get,\" said one source when asked about the possibility of\nvolcker's reappointment.\n    paul volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both\nin the united states and around the world. at a time when the\nstability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor\nnations are in question, volcker's departure would definitely\nundermine u.s. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say.\n    u.s. officials say volcker works very closely with treasury\nsecretary baker on issues like international debt and global\neconomic cooperation.\n    the two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate\nthe banking industry, but recent statements by volcker, in\nwhich he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation,\nsignalled the politically-independent central bank is coming\naround at least partially to the treasury position.\n    and a recent statement by a reagan administration official\nthat the two men saw \"exactly eye-to-eye\" on the dollar was seen\nas an indication of baker's support for the fed chairman.\n    baker is understood to have played a key role in volcker's\nreappointment to the fed in mid-1983.\n    the sources said baker respects volcker and when appointed\ntreasury secretary in february 1985, he decided to ensure a\ngood working relationship, in part because he believed the two\nkey government economic institutions have to work closely.\n    regan, treasury secretary during president reagan's first\nterm, was formerly head of wall street's largest brokerage firm\nmerrill lynch and came to washington determined to be america's\npre-eminent economic spokesman.\n    he developed a deep antipathy for volcker, whose political\nskills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took\nmuch more seriously.\n    but the sources said volcker would have to be invited to\nstay. \"is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay\notherwise,\" said one. \"he'd have to be asked,\" said stephen\naxilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the fed\nand now vice-chairman of nikko securities co. international.\n    otherwise, the list of potential candidates is not\nawe-inspiring. and if volcker left this augsut, he would leave\nbehind one of the most inexperienced fed boards in years.\n    many analysts believe this lack of collective experience --\nthe four sitting members were all appointed within the last\nthree years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the global\neconomy is threatened by instability.\n    an experienced successor, therefore, would seem a\nnecessity. one widely mentioned possibility is secretary of\nstate george shultz, whose experience as treasury secretary\nunder preesident nixon and background as a trained economist\nwould make him ideal.\n    but shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-iran\nscandal, while vice-chairman manuel johnson is regarded at 37\nyears old as too young for the job.\n    other potential candidates include economist alan\ngreenspan, frequently an informal presidential economic\nadviser, new york fed president e. gerald corrigan, federal\ndeposit insurance corp chairman william seidman, and sprinkel.\n    long a regan protege, sprinkel's chances may be damaged by\nhis patron's departure from the white house.\n reuter\n\u0003", "855": "cbt february volume down 14 pct from year ago february volume at the

and exporting countries\nended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks\nover how to set the quotas. no further meeting to discuss\nquotas was set, delegates said.\n    quotas, the major device used to stabilize prices under the\ninternational coffee agreement, were suspended a year ago after\nprices soared following a damaging drought in brazil.\n    with no propects for quotas in sight, heavy producer\nselling initially and a price war among commercial coffee\nroasting companies will ensue, the trade sources predicted.\n    lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarket\nshelf this spring, coffee dealers said.\n    the u.s. and brazil, the largest coffee importer and\nexporter respectively, each laid the blame on the other for the\nbreakdown of the talks.\n    jon rosenbaum, u.s. assistant trade representative and\ndelegate to the talks, said in a statement after the council\nadjourned, \"a majority of producers, led by brazil, were not\nprepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective\ncriteria.\n    \"we want to insure that countries receive export quotas\nbased on their ability to supply the market, instead of their\npolitical influence in the ico.\"\n    brazilian coffee institute (ibc) president jorio dauster\ncountered, \"negotiations failed because consumers tried to\ndictate quotas, not negotiate them.\"\n    previously, quotas were determined by historical amounts\nexported, which gave brazil a 30 pct share of a global market\nof about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. a majority of producers wanted\nquotas to continue under this basic scheme.\n    but most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers\nproposed carving up the export market on the basis of\nexportable production and stocks, which would reduce brazil's\nshare to 28.8 pct.\n    consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes\nin many countries' export capabilities and make coffee more\nreadily available to consumers when they need it.\n    a last-minute attempt by colombia, the second largest\nexporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interim\nproposal could not bring the two sides together.\n    delegates speculated brazil's financial problems,\nillustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on\nbank debt, have increased political pressure on the country to\nprotect its coffee export earnings.\n    developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily\non coffee earnings, particularly some african nations and\ncolombia, are likely to be hurt the most by the ico's failure\nto agree quotas, analysts said.\n    the expected drop in prices could result in losses of as\nmuch as three billion dlrs in a year, producer delegates\nforecast.\n    the ico executive board will meet march 31, but the full\ncouncil is not due to meet again until september, delegates\nsaid.\n reuter\n\u0003", "876": "ec ministers postpone talks on saving dairy pact european community (ec)

cost-cutting\nmeasures only started to bite in the third quarter of 1986.\n    but the report said over half the economy -- especially the\ncommerce, financial, and business services sectors -- continued\nto be depressed by weakness in the surrounding regional\neconomies and an excess of domestic property.\n    the sources said the fragility of the economic recovery\nsuggested the government would not introduce much of its\nplanned consumption tax in the coming financial year.\n    in last year's budget hu said he planned to set up\ncollecting machinery for the tax. economists said a campaign\nagainst smoking this year might be the opportunity for him to\nlevy the tax on tobacco as a first step towards its wider use.\n    the sources said the government does not look likely

surplus of three billion.\n    lower tax revenue was balanced by rising investment income\nand stringent controls on government operating expenditure,\nhelped by the wage-freeze policy.\n    anthony

of the\ntax benefits were given last year. the economy has already\nstarted moving so it does not need government support.\"\n    last week's economic report attributed the one pct decline\nin domestic demand last year mainly to a sharp decline in\nprivate construction, so this sector hopes for some relief from\nthe budget, economists said.\n    the economic report said the sector's activity declined by\n25.3 pct in calendar 1986 after a 13.9 pct contraction in 1985.\na further decline is expected in 1987.\n    but in last year's budget a 30 pct rebate on tax for\nindustrial and commercial properties was raised to 50 pct until\nthe end of 1988, so the most hu is likely to do is add\nincentives for creating property investment unit trusts.\n    the only measures known to be in tomorrow's budget are\nincentives to encourage population growth, including incentives\nto families who have three children.\n    deputy prime minister goh chok tong has already announced\nthe

on a substituted tax year, not the\nfiscal year ending june 30, and as a result has incurred tax at\nthe 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings, cra said in a statement.\n    consequently, it has funds available for distribution with\ndividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputation\nlegislation before determining the final payout, it said.\n    despite the higher net earnings, cra said 1986

peking itself would have to persuade\ncongress to change laws which limit its exports.\n     the official international business newspaper today\npublished china's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the\nvisit of u.s. secretary of state george shultz.\n     \"it is extremely important that the u.s. market reduce its\nrestrictions on chinese imports, provide the needed facilities\nfor them and businessmen from both sides help to expand chinese\nexports,\" the editorial said.\n     \"the u.s. should quickly discard its prejudice against\nfavourable tariff treatment for chinese goods and admit china\ninto the generalised system of preference (gsp).\n     \"despite easing of curbs on u.s. technology exports in\nrecent years, control of them is still extremely strict and\ninfluences normal trade between the two countries,\" it added\n     the paper also printed an article by china's commercial\ncounsellor in its washington embassy, chen shibiao, who said\nthat \"all kinds of difficulties and restrictions\" were preventing\nbilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.\n     he named them as u.s. protectionist behaviour, curbs on\ntechnology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.\n     the paper also printed a table showing that, since\nbilateral trade began in 1972, china has had a deficit every\nyear except 1972 and 1977. it shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits\nat 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs.\n     a u.s. embassy official said the u.s. did not accept\npeking's trade figures at all, mainly because they exclude\ngoods shipped to hong kong and then trans-shipped to u.s. while\nu.s. figures are based on country of origin.\n     he said that, if china wants to obtain gsp status, it will\nhave to lobby congress itself to persaude it to amend several\nlaws which currently prevent peking getting such status.\n     the u.s. trade act of 1974 says that to qualify for gsp,\nchina must be a member of the general agreement of tariffs and\ntrade (gatt), for which it applied in july 1986, and \"not be\ndominated or controlled by international communism.\"\n     the official said china was well aware of the laws, some\nof which date to the anti-communist early 1950's, but that\nthere is not sufficient political will in the u.s. to change\nthem.\n     china has been the subject of about a dozen cases\ninvolving anti-dumping in the u.s. within the last two years,\nwhich the u.s. side won, he said.\n     but, for the first time, china signed last week an\nagreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain\nexports of at least two categories of steel goods, which may\nlead the u.s. side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added.\n     another diplomat said willingness to provide such\nvoluntary export restraints would be an important issue in\nbilateral trade issues and in peking's application to gatt.\n     \"china has the potential to disrupt world markets,\nespecially in textiles. other gatt countries will be nervous\nabout china in this respect. but there is a precedent for other\ncentralled planned economies in gatt,\" the diplomat said.\n     poland, czechoslovakia, hungary and romania are members of\ngatt but none has china's massive market potential for imports\nor its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports.\n     in a speech today in the northeast city of dalian, u.s.\nsecretary of state george shultz said his country welcomed\nchina's interest in participating in gatt.\n     \"the process of chinese accession will not be accomplished\novernight -- the gatt rules were not designed for a large\neconomy of the chinese type,\" shultz said.\n     \"china can play an important role by actively joining gatt\ndiscussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and\nenhance market access for exports worldwide. china can further\ndevelop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum\nbenefit from its gatt participation,\" he said.\n     the problems facing u.s.-china trade and gatt membership\nare similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen\nregard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especially\nfor exports, and a de facto dual currency system.\n     in a memorandum backing its application presented to gatt\nlast month, china said it was gradually reforming its economic\nsystem and replacing mandatory instruction with

funaro and his west\ngerman counterpart gerhard stoltenberg, also believed brazil\nshould come up with a convincing economic recovery program.\n    their comments echoed those of british chancellor of the\nexchequer nigel lawson, who met funaro yesterday.\n    funaro is currently on a european trip seeking to involve\ngovernments in negotiations with commercial banks on\nrescheduling part of brazil's foreign debt, which totals some\n109 billion dlrs. but lawson told funaro brazil had to solve\nits problems with the banks rather than governments.\n    diplomatic sources in bonn said funaro would leave early\ntomorrow morning for zurich after meeting stoltenberg this\nevening.\n    funaro has rejected suggestions for negotiations with the\nimf and said there is no question of brazil agreeing to an\nausterity program with the fund.\n    however, the west german banking sources said institutions\nhere felt it was particularly important that brazil presented a\ncredible recovery program and that there be a \"rapprochement\"\nwith the imf.\n    \"consultations are the least that can be expected,\" said one\nbanker.\n    funaro's trip follows the decision by brazil 10 days ago

banker closely involved in brazilian debt\nnegotiation offered qualified support for a call from funaro\nfor a change in the structure of the advisory committee of\nbanks which has coordinated

he said brazil\nmight adopt a different approach to its creditor banks,\ninvolving separate discussions with the regions.\n    such a move would be in brazil's interest, since european\nbanks have been more supportive than u.s. banks of alternative\ndebt solutions, such as interest capitalisation.\n    the senior banker was strongly opposed to a purely regional\napproach, saying: \"there must be one committee and one solution.\"\nbut he added: \"there must be an understanding that special\nrequests from special regions be taken into account.\"\n    german banks had objected to the fact that the idea of\ninterest capitalisation had been rejected in the committee. it\nwas imperative that alternative options be considered. \"the menu\nmust become richer,\" the banker said.\n    banking

to\nensure that volcker, first appointed in 1979 by president\ncarter, will not be offered a third term by president reagan.\n    only volcker's key allies in the reagan administration,\nvice-president george bush and treasury secretary james baker,\nkept regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said.\n    sources close to the administration say regan leaked

relationship, in part because he believed the two\nkey government economic institutions have to work closely.\n    regan, treasury secretary during president reagan's first\nterm, was formerly head of wall street's largest brokerage firm\nmerrill lynch and came to washington determined to be america's\npre-eminent economic spokesman.\n    he developed a deep antipathy for volcker, whose political\nskills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took\nmuch more seriously.\n    but the sources said volcker would have to be invited to\nstay. \"is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay\notherwise,\" said one. \"he'd have to be asked,\" said stephen\naxilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the fed\nand now vice-chairman of nikko securities co.

many analysts believe this lack of collective experience --\nthe four sitting members were all appointed within the last\nthree years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the global\neconomy is
